This is my portfolio website, still young in age. There are many curricular and extracurricular projects that will still be added to this as time goes on. Sadly, I had dealt with storage issues halfway through my school program, a lot of data was lost on some of my early projects, I've been trying to rebuild them along with keeping up on coursework and new projects of my own ever since.
